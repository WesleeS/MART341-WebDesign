# Weslee's Web Design Repo
Hope I get to soak in some skills for graphic design-- I could definately use some growth there!

Changelog (mostly an assignment log)
- 9/5 Initial Repo, wrote the Readme too. Oh and that Assignment-1 Folder.
- 9/15 Oh wow 10 days later and I do assignment 2 and 3. That took a while! Made sure everything new is very strict to the format guidelines too. I don't think I was doing anything wrong as I have a 100% sofar but better safe than sorry.
- 9/28 MUCH longer this time for assignment 4, i gotta set myself a phone reminder to do these. Sorry, again.
- 10/1 I stayed up until 6 am playing world of warcraft with a friend and I'm feeling the effects. I pumped out a silly assignment page in 40 minutes but I feel like an old decrepit man now instead of a youthful 19 year old
- 10/8 silly chickadee page
