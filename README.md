# Weslee's Web Design Repo

Changelog (mostly an assignment log)
- 9/5 Initial Repo, wrote the Readme too. Oh and that Assignment-1 Folder.
- 9/15 Oh wow 10 days later and I do assignment 2 and 3. That took a while! Made sure everything new is very strict to the format guidelines too. I don't think I was doing anything wrong as I have a 100% sofar but better safe than sorry.
- 9/28 MUCH longer this time for assignment 4, i gotta set myself a phone reminder to do these. Sorry, again.
- 10/1 I stayed up until 6 am playing world of warcraft with a friend and I'm feeling the effects. I pumped out a silly assignment page in 40 minutes but I feel like an old decrepit man now instead of a youthful 19 year old
- 10/8 silly chickadee page
- 10/22 Another delay of 2 assignment uploads and then writing a changelog. Added a page for the American Robin for assign-7 and the Grey-Go-Away for assign-8
- 10/29 feeling the effects of my covid shot update. Ouch. Oh and assignment 9 is added with a basic how-to for quilting
- 11/5 Oh! It was just 1 week since my shot. Anyhoo, assignment 10 is from me birdwatching last week while fevered
- 11/12 Assignment 11! A slight notice that i'll be missing at the end of november for a convention, so i'll definately make my assignment... 13(?) about that.
- 11/19 Turned in 12 today, and next weekend (rather than the one after) I'll be turning in the next assignment early in order to go on my trip with no worries about due dates. 
- 11/28 Like I said, early 13 submission. Be back in a week! This one is a little hamfisted but it's ffffine enough.
