                       There I was. Walking to the route 12 bus stop west of the oval (a bit pass the dining
                       hall, you know the deal) when I saw something swoop across the walkway and into a tree!
                       Too small to be a crow, and too black to be a pigeon. Of course, my interest was piqued
                       and I detoured over to the tree to inspect it!
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Then I saw this beauty! Nationally iconic but definately not from around here! Introducing,
                       the Pilated Woodpecker. These fellas are from the far east of Northern America, and seeing
                       one all the way here is nothing but extraordinary! My bus still had a half hour 'till 
                       arrival, so I stuck around and snapped some photos on my phone's camera.

                        I know these assignments aren't read too indepth-- there's tons of submissions
                        to grade, but really I'd like to ramble a little personally here too. I'm 
                        actually on my way to a trip to Philidelphia and sometimes I'm a nervous
                        little ball swapping between gleening excitement and a bit knotted in my gut.
                        I feel like, seeing this bird here was a sign everything's going to be all
                        right. A bit silly, but it meant alot to me.
                        <br>
                        I'm scarcely far from Montana, and... I suppose seeing this woodpecker was a 
                        reminder that there's more 'world' out in the world, not just some scary place.
                        Birds fly in other places too, and people live outside my little bubble here 
                        in the big sky state.

                With that, I'll also likely be submitting next assignment over Thanksgiving/Fall Break,
                as I'm gone for the trip at the end of Novemeber. Just that weekend, but I wanted to do 
                my due dilligence.
