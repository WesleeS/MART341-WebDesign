            <p>
                Alright, so most people call it the chickadee (from the <i>'chicka-dee-dee-dee-dee'</i> call)
                but REALLY it's funnier to call it such. Specifically I saw a "black-capped-chickadee" in the 
                bush over by my birdfeeder, but I couldn't get a good picture due to how fast they flew off!
                <br>
                You can spot one from:
                <li> Their call (duh)</li>
                <li> Their black head and white cheeks </li>
                <li> they're also really common here, like REALLY common. Set out proper suet and you'll see em</li>
                <br>
                That guy on the right is NOT a chickadee, he is UNRELATED.
