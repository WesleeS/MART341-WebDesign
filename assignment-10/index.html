                Alright so this lil guy I think I've a nest of them in my yard? I just moved to this new place a few months ago but 
                this is the FIRST time I've seen these guys around.

                    So the story goes I got my covid booster/refresh on a friday last week (or 2 weeks ago? i think 2) and
                    had absolutely nothing to do while I was burning a 101 fever on a saturday. Too dizzy to play Baldurs Gate 3
                    or play WoW with my party, so I just dumped a bag of unsalted almonds in the empty birdbath. It's not a great 
                    idea to refill it with water during winter so... yeah.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Anyhow, I sit down by the backdoor and watch while listening to music on my phone and I SEE THIS PORKER,
                    gorging down 3 almonds at a time and flying off. Then, they'd come back and eat more. I swear it was maybe 6
                    trips total.
                    <br>
                    Definately sure there's a nest or something though, if he was just EATING all those almonds himself then I'm
                    not sure he would've been able to fly by the last trip.
                    </p>

            </div>
            

            <p style=" margin: 0;">
                Pretty fun way to recover from a shot though! I'm excited to setup more birding stuff in my lawn by the time spring 
                comes around.
