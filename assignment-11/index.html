            <p style="margin: 0; padding-bottom: 1em;">
                No sightings to prompt these, but they were mentioned in my weekly tabletop game and I thought about 
                sharing them this time around for my project!

                        Since images aren't really required, I decided to be a little lazy and instead copy an embed link 
                        from youtube to rush things along a little. <br>
                        We've got a silly little video of a hummingbird feeding their babes.

                        <br>
                        The reason for hummingbirds today is I'm thinking a little bit about spring, and wishing it would
                        atleast start to snow a little! I hate this part of pre-winter, post-fall, where theres no leaves, 
                        no color, and not even any snowfall. I'm a huge fan of thick blizzards too! So it's not the cold 
                        bothering me or anything.
                        <br>
                        Oh and back to the birds, I'm hoping this year I'll get some luck with attracting hummingbirds 
                        to the feeder. Last place didn't have too much luck but I saw a single one when I moved to my new house!

                        Bird triva, the Allen's Hummingbird is an urban species of hummingbirds! They're from the pacific coast 
                        and tragically not from around here. Best chances is viewing them in Cali, and sometimes they go to central america 
                        during the winter seasons. Most tend to stay all year though, given California doesn't really go too deep into
                        winter.

                Doing great all around, crossing my fingers about an internship at Campus Compact I might be getting next semester.

                p.s., the :hover element is the hummingbird text. The font used is also the Segoe UI family, oft used with bootstrap projects.
                I'm a fan of the readability.
