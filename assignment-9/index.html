                    First up, I'll be going through making a "Shoo-Fly Block". Real simple one, involving 5 solid tiles and 4 HST's (Half-Square Triangles)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To start, we'll need to decide a seam size and the overall size of our block.  
                    <br>
                    A good standard is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">3 inch block</span>, with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">quarter inch seam</span>. Many quilting guides use these measurements as it's big enough that the 
                    assembled block makes a nice quilt, and small enough that you can put a good few together and make a decent design.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Further, the Shoo-Fly is a great block to start with as you get practice with cutting, assembling HST's, and finally the sewing portion.

                    The first tiles to cut will be the full squares preferably-- the easiest by far too. For this tutorial they'll be <span style="font-weight: bold;">3.5 by 3.5 inches</span>
                    This is just the finished size, 3, plus double the seam for both edges. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cut yourself 4 tiles of a background color, and 1 tile of a primary/foreground color. Quilting really is just alot of geometry regarding these sizings, 
                    so it helps to plan these out in advance. Those 4 tiles could be each measured one by one, or a row measuing 14 inches by 3.5 which you cut 3 more times to make 4 tiles. Or one big 7 by 7 tile you cut twice for 4 tiles total.
                    Figure out what works best for you, and go from there.

                    I swear, the moment I figured this out I was astonished! Worked like magic, and makes total sense geometrically.
                    <br>
                    You can make 8 HST's via this method:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Take two pieces of fabric, measuring 9x9 inches each</li>
                        <li>Lay them on eachother, such that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">topsides of each</span> are touching
                        on the inside. This is the side the design is on, and typically where the color is richest.</li>
                        <li>Draw your diagonal lines, each corner to the opposite</li>
                        <li>Sew your seams a quarter inch from those diagonals</li>
                        <li>Finally, cut horizontally and vertically.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Unfurl those and be pleasently surprised! There's alternative ways to make 2 at a time, or even 16.
                    <br>
                    The 8x8 method is quite simple, so that's why I illustrated that rather than the 4.
                    <br>
                    To make 4 at a time instead, only do half such that you'd only make a single horizontal cut.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There's a handy site <a href="https://blog.wholecirclestudio.com/?p=5942">here</a> which has charts and a few more methods to peruse.

                    Finally, to assemble your pieces!
                    <ol>
                        <li>Take your first row or column of pieces, however your brain works best</li>
                        <li>Lay the second piece over the first, the "tops" together, aka the colored faces inside</li>
                        <li>Sew the proper side, a quarter inch away from the edge. That's what the seam is</li>
                    </ol>
                    Unfurl those and be pleasently surprised! Again! Your first two connected pieces. Repeat this proccess to connect
                    the third piece to the end of the second. 
                    <br>
                    Finally, when you are ready to connect all of your rows, you'll do the same approach. Tops together, and it helps to plan in advance
                    using sewing pins to create spines.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The final, total Shoo-Fly block should be 9.5 by 9.5 inches -- the quarter seams plus the size of the finished tiles, 3 inches.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first step to making a quilt is making tons of blocks, and this is exactly it. Every block connected the same way we joined 
                    these prior tiles.
