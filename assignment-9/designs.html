                    For designing a quilt, it all comes down to taste. An easy thing to do is a "sampler quilt", where much like a sampler platter 
                    you have a bunch of blocks you sew together in a grid or alternative layout in order to have a huge scale of variety.

                    There's also medalion quilts, which feature a large central block in the middle.

                    For starting out, it's worth just thinking of all the ways you can arrange even the simplist tiles. Here's a great demo video 
                    of just arranging HST's, and here's a <a href="https://www.generations-quilt-patterns.com/quilt-patterns.html">site with a bunch of easy designs</a> to just pick and start.
