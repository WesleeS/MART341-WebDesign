                Alright so unfortunately, I don't have as much time as I would've wanted to do this assignment as I'll be 
                totally gone for a few days -- which will encompass the whole weekend. I'll be reusing some pages from my
                own existing projects which will be, some comfortable little cookbook pages from SQL class. If interested,
                the recipes I'll be copying are from the Hero's Feast book, a set of neat little d&d themed meals
                <br>
                Again, apologies that it isn't my usual polish (Well, the recipe pages will be. Not this page though.)
                <br>
                <br>
                It's the minimum though! Scroll in on those recipes and it'll format for column scrolling on mobile.
                <br>
                This page is just a column by default, as there's not enough to say warrenting a wide view of it.
