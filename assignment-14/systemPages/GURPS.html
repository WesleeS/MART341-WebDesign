                <h1>GURPS</h1>
                <p>
                Known as the Generic Universal Roleplaying System, GURPS is built as a deeply simulationist system which manifests it
                as being as utilitarian and dense as possible. Not that that's a bad thing, it's just so incredibly crunchy to account
                for as many variables as possible. I've had a buncha fun playing it though, and it was my system of choice for a long time.
                <br>
                <br>
                The actual play of GURPS is all done through a system of skill contest rolls (to generalize) and via rolls of 3d6. A lovely 
                bell curve. Further, GURPS sheets are very <i>very</i> mechanically customizable. They're built from advantages, disadvantages,
                skills and stats. This is done through a point buy system, where players are alotted a number of points ranging from 100 to even 300.
                These are spent to flesh out the character even further such as advantages give various abilities which aren't directly tied to 
                stats likewise with disadvantages, or skills which use your stats for rolls.
                <br>
                Right off the bat, this isn't a framework explicitly by any means-- however the system is so open-ended that it can 
                fit loads of settings, intents, systems, styles, and so on. Unfortunately, GURPS isn't as bent towards cinematic type games 
                by default, so it's best to keep this as an option for crunchier and deeply mechanical options. It's great if you want to do 
                math though! and I'm freaky like that, and love adding numbers.

                <p>
                    <p>
                        Let's checkout an example of a weapon yeah? In this example, the "Shortsword" catagory. This covers the 
                        weapons that, well, use the shortsword skill to attack!
                        <br>
                        The big chain of skills (DX-5, Broadsword-2, Force Sword-4, and so on) are called defaults, which you roll at
                        if you lack the shortsword skill. Thus, if a broadsword master was to pickup a random cutlass, they'd be rolling 
                        with their broadsword skill minus two (or another higher skill, but we're assuming Broadsword-2 is still supremely high.)
                        <br>
                        Next up, the TL refers to the "Tech-Level" of a given item. Whether it's stone age, iron tools, the atomic age, or 
                        far in the space.
                        <br> Then, lets focus on the damage. The cutlass is "sw cut" or "thr imp" which refers to swing cutting or thrust impaling
                        respectively. When you swing, you have a greater force due to the rotation whereas the thrust is weaker due to less 
                        imparted force. Further, a cut tends to be less damaging than an impale (though there's exceptions). Jabbing someone 
                        deeply with a spear can be much more damaging than cutting someone across with the tip. 
                        <br> To speed round with the rest, the reach indicates the distance to use it (in this case, 1 yard reach). Parry marks 
                        a bonus or penatly to attempts to parry with the weapon, and finally ST is the minimum Strength needed to use it effectively.
                        Consider that the average score for something is 10, given the distribution  for rolls from 3 to 18. Comfortably in 
                        the middle.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Obviously GURPS isn't all about attacks, but I just wanted to show the density of math in this game. I love it!

                    Published by Steve Jackson games, I first knew this company for the game "Munchkin". Nothing
                    like GURPS actually, but worth mentioning. GURPS has been around way way longer though, and has 
                    modern software for sheet management on par with Office Spreadsheets in regards to number crunching.
                    <br>
                    Big fan of the "Gurps Character Sheet", I used that tons.
