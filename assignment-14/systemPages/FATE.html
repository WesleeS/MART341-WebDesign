                <h1>FATE Core</h1>
                <p>
                  FATE is the last one for the list, as it's getting late in the day and I've been writing these all day long (well, first 
                  I had to do the Foundation framework setup and then learn it, but you know...) and FATE is a nice slim one to wrap up on.
                  The entire system is "Aspects", Skills, Stunts, and that's it. Almost as light as Microlite, FATE is what a cinematic GURPS 
                  would entail. There's little mechanical focus on realism, and instead a focus on what's narrative based or important to the 
                  "scene". 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  To start off, Skills are what we're familiar with. They're a simple integer skill that you add to your roll-- oh and FATE uses
                  fudge dice, which are d6's that only have sides denoted with a +, -, or a blank face. Roll 4 of those, and add them up. 
                  <br>
                  e.g., a roll might be a [-] [+] [-] [ ]. This adds up to be a net -1, which you then add your skill to (such as athletics, 
                  or empathy, and so on).
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The real meat though are Aspects, which everything has. You have aspects, the enemies have aspects, whole organizations have 
                  aspects, the alleyway you're in has aspects, even the whole world itself might have befitting aspects. These add bonuses or 
                  reroll checks where fitting. Such as, the alleyway may be "Dark and Dirty", implying an atmosphere that's easy to hide in.
                  Thus, it makes sense to add a +2 bonus (all aspects add +2) to your stealth roll. However, you may be "compelled" to miss a 
                  shot in this alleyway due to the lighting. Thus, the GM may reward you with a bonus Fate Point to spend on adding bonuses with
                  aspects.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Let's continue the example. You're a ranger with 3 fate points to your name. Infact, you're so renowned that you have an
                  aspect titled "Sentry of the City". A real vigilante sort of guy. You've also got another aspect, that you've made a "Vow 
                  to Protect the Weak", and this alleyway's got a group of muggers surrounding someone. Lastly, you've created your own 
                  aspect on the scene-- you've already aimed your bow and arrow at the leader, and are ready to strike. 
                  <br>
                  That last sentance is a newly made aspect-- let's call it "Aimed". This one is different, and because it was freshly made
                  this scene from your action, you can Invoke this aspect for free.
                  <br>
                  Now, we're attacking with a "Shoot" skill. Lets presume a skill of +3, and you roll a net 0 with the fudge dice. That's just 3.
                  We want to improve our roll with these scene traits, so we'll spend a fate point each to invoke "Sentry of the City", and another 
                  for "Vow to Protect the Weak". That's a total of +4 (+2 from each invoke) with one fate point leftover. Our final count is +7 to hit 
                  the thug. They still have to defend, but now the fight has begun!

                    FATE is published by Evil Hat Productions, a pretty common publisher if you've read enough indie ttrpgs.
                    They've produced Fate (duh), Blades in the Dark (a PBTA system!), Dresden Files (built off the fate system!), 
                    and Thirsty Sword Lesbians (another PBTA) to name the most popular.
