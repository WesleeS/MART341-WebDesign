              <h1>Powered by the Apocolypse</h1>
              So the basis of this system lies in the "playbook" model. For those familiar with class based systems (think D&D, Pathfinder, 
              Shadowrun, so on and so forth) your playbook is more in line with a narrative archetype. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Play is done through a combination of Moves provided by your playbook and roles of 2d6 
              to supplement that feel of randomness with most ttrpgs. Further, a move will modify regular game behaviour in some way that's 
              unique to your playbook. Let's rip an example out of a system I have on hand-- during my trip to philly for PAX Unplugged I 
              grabbed a copy of the ROOT ttrpg, where the setting originally had traction as a sort of "strategy city-builder" type game, where 
              you compete with other players for control over the board. Think Catan. 
              <br>

                    <div class="media-object-section">
                        <p>Anyway detour aside, lets look at The Adventurer. It's described as, <br>"<i>You are a peaceful, diplomatic vagabond, making allies from those you aid, perhaps toppling greater powers by forging strong bonds with others</i>",
                        so obviously a friendly tilt compared to more aggressive playbooks. They can select from a list of moves including:
                        <li>Sterling Reputation, Which lets you gain faction prestige faster.
                        </li>
                        <li>Subduing Strikes, Which lets you attack with cunning rather than might.
                        </li>
                        <li>Talon on the Pulse, Which lets you ask questions more effectively.
                        </li>
                        <li>Orator, Which lets you convince gatherings of people.
                        </li>
                        <li>Well Read, Which improves your cunning.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fast Friends, Which lets you befriend people quicker, at the cost of exhaustion.
                        </li>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                Pretty clearly, the avaliable moves for this playbook are very beneficial to party "faces", a sort 
                of dedicated leader in social situations as to improve the group's standing thanks to their charisma.
                You'll very easily flourish in situations where you can "talk it out" with other people or when gathering 
                information, but you might crumple more in combat in comparison to playbooks such as The Bandit.
                <p>
                
                <div class="media-object stack-for-small">
                    <div class="media-object-section">
                        <p>The Bandit is a much more combative playbook, which rewards aggressive stances
                            in situations. It reads, <br>"<i>You are a bandit, a thief-by-force, dangerous and threatening, but perhaps with the capacity to turn your axe to good use...and all the better if you get paid for it</i>"
                        </li>
                        <li>Eye for Battle, Which lets you roll might rather than cunning when in danger.
                        </li>
                        <li>Ironhide, Which lets you take less damage and deal more harm.
                        </li>
                        <li>Loot and Plunder, Which lets you scoop up more goodies.
                        </li>
                        <li>Merciful Might, Which lets you befriend people you've saved easier.
                        </li>
                        <li>Plan of Attack, Which lets you use your might to aid in battle better.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fearsome Visage, Which lets you scare enemy factions easier.
                        </li>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="media-object-section">
                        <div class="thumbnail">

                    </div>
                    
                </div>

                <p>
                    Anyway to round up this page, the idea is that playbooks play a deeper part in your 
                    character's behaviour and actions compared to systems such as D&D or PF which give you 
                    abilities, and aims to direct you towards a deeper narrative archetype. Further, they're
                    able to be much much more pertinant to the setting.
                </p>

                <p>As said before, although it's a system, Apocolypse World has become a greater framework (get it?) 
                    represented widely within many indie ttrpg titles. Notable to include:
                <li>Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game</li>
                <li>ROOT: RPG</li>
                <li>Dungeon World</li>
                <li>Apocolypse Keys</li>
                <li>Ironsworn</li>
                <li>Masks</li>
                <li>Blades in the Dark</li>
                <li>Wanderhome (though not a d6 system)</li>
                <br>
                And the list goes on, honestly. There's alot, but these ones I've tried personally
