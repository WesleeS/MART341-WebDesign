## woo markdown
---

I've had this one [site](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) bookmarked for like 5 years or something, real handy. I kinda hate having to look up references if I forget something (e.g., tables I rarely use, so I just sorta forget)
so using just this and skimming the table of contents is much nicer.  
The big handy elements I like using are *italics*, **bold**, and of course ***bolded italics*** when you really need the extra emphasis.  

Of course, most of the time you'll just be using stuff like css formatting with html flags (or atleast, I do) but markdown is nice for writing documentation n stuff quickly. 
Plus, it can be used vaguely for implied formatting when you're writing comments on code. I'll still use astrisks for italics or maybe forward slashes to imply a slant, or use poundsigns (even in something like C#) just to add attention to something.


### Here's a gross hotlink (specifically an absolute url, though what's makeing it gross is the fact it's not hosted here and thus the image could drop off the face of the internet at some point)
