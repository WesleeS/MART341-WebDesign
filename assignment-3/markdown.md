Since I wrote the last image in assignment 2 as a url, I figured I mightaswell do this one as a relative link.  

I use just the git webeditor just because it's quicker sorta? I mean VSC I can still preview it but when it's just a single file here that I'm typing in once, I feel like this is easier.  
It has a preview function anyway, which is all I really need (and even then, aslong as I got a good idea of what I'm making, I might not even need the preview.)
